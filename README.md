Editing code? Open the file `index.js`, we have commented a REST call. You just need to uncomment it. It will be automatically called at the end of the application deployment. This call will get you in our user base and register you for our ongoing draw. Don't forget to modify the JSON opbject sent by the API call. It will help us to contact you.
